# @culturehq/client

[![Package Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@culturehq/client.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@culturehq/client)

A JavaScript client that wraps the CultureHQ API.

## Getting started

Install the package into your application using `npm` (`npm install @culturehq/client --save`) or `yarn` (`yarn add @culturehq/client`). Then import the package into your `node` application like:

```js
import client from "@culturehq/client";
```

### API calls

Every API call function returns a `Promise` object. You can call them with normal `Promise` semantics, as in below:

```js
const getProfile = () => {
  client.getProfile().then(response => {
    console.log(response);
  }).catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
};
```

or you can use `async`/`await` syntax, as in below:

```js
const getProfile = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await client.getProfile();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

Each function can be introspected to determine its expected parameters (`expectedParams`) and optional parameters (`optionalParams`), as in:

```js
const { expectedParams, optionalParams } = client.createEvent;
```

### Sign-in state

Signed in state is handled through the client using the `signIn` and `signOut` functions. These effectively act as normal API calls but with the additional functionality of setting or clearing `localStorage` with the returned API token.

You can also manually set the API token by using the `setToken` named export. This is especially useful if the token is fixed in some context (as in most integrations).

### Upload signing

To support faster uploading, we allow images to be uploaded directly to S3, and then just send along the signed URL to the API for fetching. This allows API servers to continue processing requests instead of waiting for the upload to complete.

To use this mechanism, call this function with a file object and it will return a Promise that resolves to the URL of the file that was uploaded, as in the following example:

```js
import { signUpload } from "@culturehq/client";

signUpload(document.querySelector("#file").files[0]).then(url => {
  console.log(url);
});
```

### Pagination

Almost every one of the `list*` events is paginated, and will return pagination metadata along with the actual data of the call. The `pagination` object will look like:

```js
{ currentPage, totalPages, totalCount }
```

You can handle this pagination manually, e.g., links on the bottom of the page. You can also use the client's built-in automatic pagination capabilities by using the `autoPaginate` named export, as in the following example:

```js
import { autoPaginate } from "@culturehq/client";

const { events } = await autoPaginate("events").listEvents();
```

This will return the pagination information as normal, but the events will
be concatenated together.

### WebSocket connections

There are a few functions on the client that will establish a WebSocket connection and call a callback function when data is received. For these functions, in order to avoid leaking memory, it's important to ensure that when you're done with the subscription (for instance when the component containing it is unmounted) that you call `unsubscribe` on the subscription object. An example with React of using these functions is below:

```js
import { onNotificationReceived } from "@culturehq/client";

class MyComponent {
  state = { lastNotification: null };

  componentDidMount() {
    this.subscription = onNotificationReceived(notification => {
      this.setState({ lastNotification: notification });
    });
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.subscription) {
      this.subscription.unsubscribe();
    }
  }

  render() {
    const { lastNotification } = this.state;

    return <span>{lastNotification}<span>;
  }
}
```

The list of all of these class of functions can be found in [`src/cable.js`](src/cable.js).

### Skipping preflight checks

You can avoid all of the CORS preflight checks if the domains of both the request and response match. You can accomplish this only if you're on a subdomain and the server that you're trying to hit is on another subdomain of the same parent domain.

The way it works is by changing the `document.domain` value to be the common parent domain of both the request and the response. The request can just be changed by setting `document.domain` in the main window (this is allowed by browsers because you're always allowed to set it to a suffix of the current domain).

The response domain can be changed by embedding an `iframe` into the page that contains a specially crafted page from the response server. The `iframe` contains a small HTML page with a script tag that changes the `document.domain` value to match the requesting server. You can then pull the `fetch` function from the child window into the parent and use that to hit the server.

If using this code in production on a `culturehq` subdomain, we can embed an `iframe` using the API's /proxy` endpoint which contains the code to change the `document.domain` value to `culturehq.com`. We can then do the same in this window and pull the `fetch` function from the child window. This logic is encapsulated in the `skipPreflightChecks` and can be used like so:

```js
import { skipPreflightChecks } from "@culturehq/client";

skipPreflightChecks();
```

## Development

First, install the dependencies with `yarn`. Run `yarn test` to run the tests with `jest`. Run `yarn lint` to run linting with `eslint`.
