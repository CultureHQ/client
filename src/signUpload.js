/**
 * To support faster uploading, we allow images to be uploaded directly to S3,
 * and then just send along the signed URL to the API for fetching. This allows
 * API servers to continue processing requests instead of waiting for the upload
 * to complete.
 *
 * To use this mechanism, call this function with a file object and it will
 * return a Promise that resolves to the URL of the file that was uploaded, as
 * in the following example:
 *
 *     import { signUpload } from "@culturehq/client";
 *
 *     signUpload(document.querySelector("#file").files[0]).then(url => {
 *       console.log(url);
 *     });
